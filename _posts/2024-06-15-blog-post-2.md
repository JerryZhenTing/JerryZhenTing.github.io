Say there are 1000 bottles of water and one of them is poisoness. A rat dies in exactly 10min after drinking one drop of poison(which means however many bottles you mix with the poisoness one, a rat still dies from drinking the resulting solution). Now, if you have only 10min, how many rats (min)to you need to find out which one is poinsoness.
